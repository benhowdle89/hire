                    <p>I've specialised in JavaScript based tech since 2010 and led the JavaScript development of <a href="http://kashflow.com">KashFlow's</a> Backbone.js web-app in 2013. In 2014, I spent half my time helping startups architect and improve their front-ends, and the other half releasing my <a href="http://benhowdle.im">own products</a> and <a href="http://github.com/benhowdle89">open source projects</a>. I've also been <a href="http://benhowdle.im/workshops">training</a> individuals &amp; companies alike on their JavaScript skills.</p>

				<h3>Consulting</h3>
				<p class="meta breathe-bottom">JavaScript (+ Node.js) projects</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">From working with larger teams to smaller startups, I'm well versed in where and how bottlenecks can appear, then how to solve and avoid them. I'll work with you or your team to plan, architect and review how you can achieve seamless development, whether its mapping out an API or picking a JavaScript framework, I can impart my knowledge and point you in the right direction.</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">Consulting is booked in 2 hour blocks, at <strong>£250/hour</strong>.</p>
				<p class="meta">As a guide, it would be better to use this time for me to help you plan and advise, not actually develop.</p>

				<h3>Private training</h3>
				<p class="meta breathe-bottom">On-site JavaScript workshops for your team</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">Tailored, custom training delivered face-to-face is unbeatable. We'll chat beforehand about the specific areas that would be best to cover, which I'll then use to create the workshop.</p>

				<h3>Short-term projects</h3>
				<p class="meta breathe-bottom">For when you need more than consulting</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">If you need an extra pair of hands to see a project through, or a standalone project you haven't got the resource for, I do also take on short-term projects (no longer than 6 weeks).</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">Short-term projects at <strong>£500/day</strong> (front-end and/or Node.js)</p>
