                    <p>I've specialised in JavaScript based tech since 2010 and led the JavaScript development of <a href="http://kashflow.com">KashFlow's</a> Backbone.js web-app in 2013. In 2014, I spent half my time helping startups architect and improve their front-ends, and the other half releasing my <a href="http://benhowdle.im">own products</a> and <a href="http://github.com/benhowdle89">open source projects</a>. I've also been <a href="http://benhowdle.im/workshops">training</a> individuals &amp; companies alike on their JavaScript skills.</p>

				<h3>Consulting</h3>
				<p class="meta breathe-bottom">JavaScript (+ Node.js) projects</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">From working with larger teams to smaller startups, I'm well versed in where and how bottlenecks can appear, then how to solve and avoid them. I'll work with you or your team to plan, architect and review how you can achieve seamless development, whether its mapping out an API or picking a JavaScript framework, I can impart my knowledge and point you in the right direction.</p>
				<p class="breathe-bottom">Consulting is booked in 2 hour blocks, at <strong>£250/hour</strong>.</p>
				<p class="meta">As a guide, it would be better to use this time for me to help you plan and advise, not actually develop.</p>

				<h3>Short-term projects</h3>
				<p class="meta breathe-bottom">For when you need more than consulting</p>

				<blockquote>"I hired Ben to lead the redevelopment of our SaaS application from crusty old code into something more modern. He made suggestions - along with pro's and con's - that helped us decide which way to go. We ultimately went with his recommendations. I quickly came to depend on Ben's knowledge and expertise on all aspects of the development of our Backbone.js app. His wider experience with other aspects of product architecture, such as REST APIs and CSS was also invaluable. Unlike your stereotypical uber-techie, he's also very personable and everyone enjoyed working with him. I've come to regard him as the foremost expert in his field"</blockquote>

				<p class="meta breathe-bottom"><a href="https://twitter.com/jmedwards">@jmedwards</a></p>
				<blockquote>"Ben was able to apply his front-end development and architecture experience from day one, helping us come up with and validate key architecture choices and avoid costly mistakes as we scale Kayako to be used by 10,000s organisations worldwide to support millions of end users. We found Ben's advice to be realistic and pragmatic, factoring in resource constraints, business needs of the day and balancing those with future scalability benefits. We are relieved to have had Ben part of our design process - his early contributions have saved a potentially limitless amount of developer time, pain and costs down the line."</blockquote>
